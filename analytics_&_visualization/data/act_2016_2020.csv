\1\Members of the graduating class who had taken the ACT as a percentage of all students who graduated in that school year. State percentages were calculated by ACT based on the number of high school graduates in each state as projected by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). Total percentages for the United States were calculated by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) based on NCES projections of the total number of U.S. high school graduates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The minimum score on the ACT is 1 and the maximum score is 36. Data are for high school graduates who took the ACT test during their sophomore, junior, or senior year. If a student took the ACT test more than once, the composite and subject-area scores from the most recent test were used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
